# nuxt.js with Typescript

> My classy Nuxt.js project

Playing around with nuxt and TypeScript.
Used the nuxt starter and included TypeScript with [wagerfield/nuxt-typescript](https://github.com/wagerfield/nuxt-typescript).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
